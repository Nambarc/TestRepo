Git commands/cheat sheet:

make a directory with
$ mkdir dir_name

initialize as an empty repo with
$ git init

Add a new file with
$ touch filename.extension

Keep track of which files git knows about (status) with
$ git status

Add file(s) to the staging area (pre commit collection of files to be committed) this can be done
with the command
$ git add filename.txt

Commit changes held in staging are with
$ git commit

Create a new branch to work in using (no spaces in name!!)
$ git checkout -b <branch-name$

To check which branch you are working in use
$ git branch

Add a remote origin (link project to remote repository)
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

We can then push our work to the remote location
$ git push -u origin branch-name

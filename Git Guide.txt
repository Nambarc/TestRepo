Git commands/cheat sheet:

make a directory with
$ mkdir dir_name

initialize as an empty repo with
$ git init

Add a new file with
$ touch filename.extension

Keep track of which files git knows about (status) with
$ git status

Add file(s) to the staging area (pre commit collection of files to be committed) this can be done
with the command
$ git add filename.txt

Commit changes held in staging are with
$ git commit

Create a new branch to work in using the following command (no spaces in name!!). This will also
move you into the branch.
$ git checkout -b <branch-name$

To check which branch you are working in use
$ git branch

NB.
Any commits you make will be applied to the branch you are currently working in.

Add a remote origin (link project to remote repository)
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

We can then push our work to the remote location
$ git push -u origin branch-name

NB.
Pull requests are how we merge changes we've made in branches into the master branch.
It's normally worth deleting the branch after you've merged it's changes since there is no reason
for it to exist any more. If you want to make future changes you can just make a new branch.

We can pull the most recent changes from the remote repository back to our local repo with the
command
$ git pull origin master
